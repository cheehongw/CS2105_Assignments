The steps involved in the download procedure using such a HTTP based protocol are:

1. Client initiates 3-way handshake to establish TCP channel with server.
2. After TCP channel is established, client sends HTTP GET request over channel.
3. The server responds with the HTTP 200 OK message and requested file.
4. Client replies to the server with acknowledgement upon receiving the TCP packet successfully.
5. The server closes the connection by sending a TCP packet with the FIN bit set.
6. Client acknowledges the FIN and closes the socket connection.
