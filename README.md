# CS2105_Assignments
hacking the mainframe over the internet

## Assignment 0
1. Write a simple script to calculate `crc32` checksum of a given file
2. Write a simple script to read consecutive packets from `stdin`, extract the payloads in a responsive manner and output to `stdout`
    - The testing program will simulate and feed a choppy data stream to the script

## Assignment 1
1. Use socket programming to send payloads to a target server
2. Interpret given finite state machine diagram and understand the transition between states of the target server
3. Follow the communication standard/protocol provided to establish meaningful communication with target server

## Assignment 2
1. Appreciate and use techniques that are fundamental to efficient and reliable data transfer, such as:
   - pipelining
   - caching
2. Design protocols using an amalgam of techniques to ensure reliable and fast data transfer under various sub-optimal conditions, such as:
   - re-ordering of data packets
   - data packet loss
   - unknown probility of data packet loss and re-ordering
